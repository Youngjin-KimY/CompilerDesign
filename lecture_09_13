1. Strucutre of Complier
	- sometime not using optimizer
		1. optimizing wrongly
		2. after optimizing, then difficult to do debug
	- issue of symbol table
	- warning from Code Optimizer


2. lexeme : string which correspond to token

3. Syntax Analysis
	- in the example, last have to be id, and there is no empty string, and unary oparator.
	like -x can not be existed.
	- 
4. semantic analysis
	- if int a, a cannot be name of procedure.
	case 1
	int a;
	a("hi")

	case 2
	void foo(int a, int b){
		contents
	}
	foo(1)

	case 3
	int a;
	a/0
	

5. dynamic semantic check

	int A[10]

6. code optimization 
	dead code elimination -> eliminate unreach or cannot execute.
	pg 40 : dont need to do i*n everytime in inner loop.(i is not changed in the inner loop):
